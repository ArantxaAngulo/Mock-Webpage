# Bootstrap E-Commerce Project

## Overview

This project is a responsive e-commerce website built using Bootstrap 5. It features a navigation bar, login and registration modals, a shopping cart page, and a dynamic carousel. The project is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing.

Working on this project also helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills, particularly when debugging issues related to layout and responsiveness.
